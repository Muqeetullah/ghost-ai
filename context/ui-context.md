# UI Context

## Theme

Dark only. No light mode. The visual language is a dark technical workspace — near-black backgrounds, layered surfaces, and vivid accent colors for interactive elements.

All colors are defined as CSS custom properties in `globals.css` and mapped to Tailwind tokens via `@theme inline`. Components must use these tokens — no hardcoded hex values or raw Tailwind color classes like `zinc-*`.

| Role             | CSS Variable           | Hex / Value               |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Page background  | `--bg-base`            | `#080809`                 |
| Surface          | `--bg-surface`         | `#111114`                 |
| Elevated surface | `--bg-elevated`        | `#18181c`                 |
| Subtle surface   | `--bg-subtle`          | `#1e1e23`                 |
| Default border   | `--border-default`     | `#2a2a30`                 |
| Subtle border    | `--border-subtle`      | `#3a3a42`                 |
| Primary text     | `--text-primary`       | `#f0f0f4`                 |
| Secondary text   | `--text-secondary`     | `#c0c0cc`                 |
| Muted text       | `--text-muted`         | `#808090`                 |
| Faint text       | `--text-faint`         | `#505060`                 |
| Brand accent     | `--accent-primary`     | `#00c8d4` (cyan)          |
| Brand dim        | `--accent-primary-dim` | `rgba(0, 200, 212, 0.12)` |
| AI accent        | `--accent-ai`          | `#6457f9` (indigo-purple) |
| AI text          | `--accent-ai-text`     | `#8b82ff`                 |
| Error            | `--state-error`        | `#ff4d4f`                 |
| Success          | `--state-success`      | `#34d399`                 |
| Warning          | `--state-warning`      | `#fbbf24`                 |

Tailwind utility names map to these variables. Use `bg-base`, `bg-surface`, `text-copy-primary`, `text-copy-muted`, `border-surface-border`, `text-brand`, `bg-accent-dim`, etc.

## Typography

| Role      | Font       | CSS Variable        |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------------- |
| UI text   | Geist Sans | `--font-geist-sans` |
| Code/mono | Geist Mono | `--font-geist-mono` |

Both fonts are loaded via `next/font/google` and applied as CSS variables on the `<html>` element. The base `body` uses Geist Sans with `antialiased`.

## Border Radius

Radius increases with surface depth — smaller for inner elements, larger for outer containers.

| Context           | Class         |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| Inline / small UI | `rounded-xl`  |
| Cards / panels    | `rounded-2xl` |
| Modal / overlay   | `rounded-3xl` |

## Canvas

### Node Color Palette

8 defined color pairs. Each pair specifies a dark node fill and a vivid contrasting text color tuned for readability on the dark canvas. Defined in `types/canvas.ts` as `NODE_COLORS`.

| Node fill | Text color | Character              |
| --------- | ---------- | ---------------------- |
| `#1F1F1F` | `#EDEDED`  | Neutral dark (default) |
| `#10233D` | `#52A8FF`  | Blue                   |
| `#2E1938` | `#BF7AF0`  | Purple                 |
| `#331B00` | `#FF990A`  | Orange                 |
| `#3C1618` | `#FF6166`  | Red                    |
| `#3A1726` | `#F75F8F`  | Pink                   |
| `#0F2E18` | `#62C073`  | Green                  |
| `#062822` | `#0AC7B4`  | Teal                   |

Default node color: `#1F1F1F` with `#EDEDED` text.

### Edge Style

Smooth-step path with an arrow marker. Default edge color: `#f8fafc`. Stroke width is thin — edges are visually secondary to nodes.

### Node Shapes

6 supported shapes, defined in `types/canvas.ts` as `NODE_SHAPES`. Complex shapes (diamond, hexagon, cylinder) are rendered as inline SVGs rather than CSS borders.

- `rectangle` — default general-purpose node
- `diamond` — decision / gateway
- `circle` — event / endpoint
- `pill` — service / process
- `cylinder` — database / storage
- `hexagon` — external system / boundary

### Connection Handles

Small white circular handles, hidden by default, revealed on node hover. Appear at all four sides of a node.

### Canvas Background

React Flow `<Background>` component. Canvas sits on the base background color.

## Component Library

shadcn/ui on top of Tailwind. No custom design system. Components live in `components/ui/`. Use the `shadcn` CLI to add new components rather than writing them from scratch.

## Layout Patterns

- Editor workspace: full-viewport layout — floating sidebar overlay on the left, center canvas, slide-over AI sidebar on the right.
- Sidebars: floating overlay with dark semi-transparent background and subtle border.
- Modals and dialogs: centered overlay, `rounded-3xl`, dark background with backdrop blur.
- Navbar: top bar with dark background and bottom border.

## Icons

Lucide React. Stroke-based icons only — no filled variants. Icon sizes: `h-4 w-4` for inline, `h-5 w-5` for buttons, `h-8 w-8` for feature icons in empty states.

## Authentication pages

Sign in and sign up share a responsive shell. Desktop places the brand and centered Clerk form on the left and an inset generated artwork panel with product copy overlaid on the right. Small screens show the brand and form only. The local raster artwork at `public/images/auth-horizon.png` uses a grainy dark sculptural horizon with cyan and indigo light, inspired by the supplied visual reference. Copy is accessible HTML over the dark lower portion, and the image is decorative. It is loaded through Next Image. Form appearance overrides are isolated from the account menu and profile modal.

## Brand mark

The auth header uses `components/brand/ghost-logo.tsx`, a custom cyan outline ghost with angular trailing edges and detached diagonal signals. The lowercase Geist wordmark pairs primary text with a muted `ai` suffix. Keep the mark as native SVG for crisp rendering.

## Profile access

The current user Clerk profile button lives in the right side of the navbar on both editor home and project workspaces. Canvas presence shows collaborators only and is hidden when no collaborators are present. The profile control stays above the AI sidebar.

## AI conversation and spec preview

The AI chat displays submitted messages immediately and merges them by stable ID with persisted feed history. Loading and failed history reads are distinct from an empty conversation. Spec previews use a bounded flex dialog with a vertical scroll region; headings and body copy wrap within the viewport while tables scroll horizontally in their own container.
